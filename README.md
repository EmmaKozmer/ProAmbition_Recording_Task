# ProAmbition Recording Task

Welcome to the ProAmbition Recording Task repository! This repository contains scripts and instructions for creating timestamped videos using either OBS Studio or the OpenCV library.

## Overview

This project provides two approaches for generating timestamped videos:
- OBS Studio: A popular open-source software for video recording and live streaming.
- OpenCV Library: A powerful library for computer vision that can be used to capture video from webcams and add timestamps programmatically.
